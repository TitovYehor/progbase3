**ScottPlot is an interactive plotting library for .NET that makes it easy to plot data and create graphs with C#.** The ScottPlot API is loosely styled after Matplotlib (a similar library for Python) allows users to perform most plotting operations with a single line of C# code. ScottPlot aims to be easy to use by data scientists new to C#, so its API favors the simplicity of one-line method calls (with optional, named arguments) and intentionally avoids complex paradigms (data binding, MVVM, inheritance) commonly seen in similar libraries available for the .NET platform.

**Cookbook figures were created by a console application using the [ScottPlot package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ScottPlot/).** Since this package targets .NET Standard, it can be used in Windows, Linux, and MacOS, and with .NET Framework (4.6.1 or newer) or .NET Core (2.0 or newer). Figures can be made interactive by displaying them using the ScottPlot user control for Windows Forms or WPF.

> ⚠️ **NOTICE:** This cookbook was [generated automatically](https://github.com/swharden/ScottPlot/blob/master/src/ScottPlot.Demo/ReportGenerator.cs) and contains example figures and source code _for one specific version_ of ScottPlot. As the ScottPlot API continues to evolve, source code may differ slightly between versions. New users are encouraged to review the [latest version](http://swharden.com/scottplot/cookbook) of the ScottPlot Cookbook.
