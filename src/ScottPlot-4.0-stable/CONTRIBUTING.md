### Making Changes

* **For large changes,** create an issue first so ideal implementation can be discussed before you begin working

* **For small changes,** make the change and create a pull request (no issue required)

* **Auto-format your code** or the build will fail. An autoformat script is located in the source folder.

* **Favor demonstrating new features with new tests** instead of adding new code to the demo applications or cookbook

* **Modify the minimum number of files and lines** necessary to implement the change to simplify review of your pull request
